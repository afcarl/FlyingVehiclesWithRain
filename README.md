# FlyingVehiclesWithRain (FVR)

This dataset is created for testing optical flow estimation in rainy scenes. There are in total 660 image pairs with flow ground truth in the full dataset. You may obtain it by downloading the four parts zip file in the `./full_dataset` folder of this repo. There are also 8 pairs of examples in the `./examples` directory. 


### Data Format
The image files of this dataset are all in .png format. The optical flow ground truths are in .flo format. You may refer to another repository of mine to read .flo file using Python: [Optical Flow Toolkit](https://github.com/liruoteng/OpticalFlowToolkit).
